There are many reference management softwares, EndNote and Mendeley being popular alternatives. I have used all of these. They all do much the same things, and references can be moved between them rather easily. The skills learned in this workshop largely apply to any of them.\nSo why Zotero specifically? Zotero is completely free, with no features locked behind a paywall. That makes it more accessible to you both now and in the future, whatever institutions your career takes you to. It’s also, in my opinion, the best one.\n\n\nWhy use a reference manager?\nBut why go through the effort of managing references at all? Reference managers are usually thought of as citation engines, but I think that is actually one of their less important features. Effective reference management can alleviate many of the hardships of interacting with the literature:\n\nOrganizing papers by subject, keywords, read/unread status, etc.\nKeeping PDFs of papers straight (and giving them decent names)\nTaking notes, both in annotations to the PDFs themselves or in standalone notes\nStaying abreast of newly published papers\n\nIf you think of these softwares less like citation engines and more like your personal library of literature, the literature becomes less of a daunting slog and more manageable and fun. I developed this workshop with the aim of introducing these other features of reference management beyond citation."

    "section": "Activity #2: Importing and Organizing References",
    "text": "Activity #2: Importing and Organizing References\nThe mission for this activity is to import references into Zotero from a variety of sources and organize them in case-dependent ways. Each case has its own quirks, but they all represent common use cases. Below you will find a basic Zotero orientation and some tips which apply to all the cases, followed by the 3 cases themselves. A more thorough overview of Zotero features can be found in its Documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBasic Zotero Orientation\n\n\n\nWhen you first boot up Zotero it will look something like this:\n\nThe center pane is where your list of references will appear (once you have some). On the left is the Collections Pane, which shows the collections  you create (which are a lot like folders in your file manager), as well as some default special collections (like “My Publications”). On the bottom left is the Tag Selector. Tags  are a different way of categorizing references, more akin to keywords, although you can define and set your own. On the right is the Item Pane, which shows specific information about the reference selected.\nThe Add Item(s) by Identifier button  (magic wand at the top left of the center pane) is an easy way to add items without opening the web browser. If we enter, say, a DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013, we will be greeted with a new item and an automatically attached PDF:\n\nThe DOI links to a 2011 review in Cell titled Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation. The article is part of Cell Press’s Open Archive, so Zotero was able to fetch the full text PDF along with the rest of the bibliographic information. Selecting the item in the center pane will bring up the editable bibliographic info in the item pane to the right. Clicking the little arrow at the left of the item will reveal the attachments. Double-clicking on the item will open the PDF in another tab, right in Zotero!\n\nItems and Attachments\nIndividual references in Zotero take the form of items. An item can have one of many types, e.g., journal article, book, book chapter, or preprint. An item can have any number of file attachments. While you can attach any type of file, Zotero is most agile with PDF and EPUB attachments, which can be opened and marked up within the program itself. The column headers of the center pane are customizable to your preference by right-clicking one of the headers. You could include, say, the year of publication or journal title as a column if you wanted to.\n\n\nCollections and Tags\nZotero has two primary way of organizing items. Collections  are a lot like folders on your computer; the only difference is that an item can be in any number of collections at once. This can be useful: you could file a reference under multiple subjects (e.g., “cancer”, “immunology”) as well by type (e.g., “reviews”) or something else (e.g., “to cite for 2025 paper”).\nTo create a collection, you can click the New Collection… icon  at the top left of the Collections Pane. Collections can have sub-collections. To add an item to a collection, you can right-click on it and click Add to Collection or drag the item to the collection in the Collections Pane.\nTags  are much like tags anywhere else, short labels which often describe content in the form of keywords. You can click on tags in the Tag Selector to filter your library by those tags. Imports from PubMed and certain journal websites can bring with them keywords automatically. You can also manually add custom tags to an item by navigating to the Tags  icon in the Item Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCase A: Importing from PDFs (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re preparing for your QE and you’ve been sent a bunch of “very important literature” to review by your mentor in the form of email attachments. They are all PDFs of a range of topics and item types. Find a way to import them into Zotero (with their citation metadata) and organize them intelligently.\n\nClick here to download caseA.zip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGreen flag criteria:\n\n\n\nRaise the green flag when everyone at your table has:\n\nall 8 PDFs are in Zotero\nthey all have bibliographic data associated with them (a parent item)\nat least some are in a collection and/or have a tag\n\n\n\n\nTips for Case A:\nZotero is good at importing PDFs, and can often read in or acquire the metadata from the text within it. The simplest way to import PDFs is to drag them from your file manager to the center area. Alternatively, you can click the Add Attachment icon  at the top left of the center pane.\nZotero will usually be able to create a parent item with the appropriate metadata from the PDF, but not always. In this case, the attachment will not have a parent item, i.e., it will be “naked”, without any bibliographic data attached to it. In this case you will need to get the info from another source (like a website) or create an item with the appropriate data manually (the New Item icon  at the top left of the center pane). Dragging the attachment into that new item will pair it to that item.\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\nDoes Zotero automatically handle some types PDFs better than others?\nWhat options might you try if a PDF does not import appropriately?\nAre there other types of items which may be useful to have in a reference library besides journal articles?\nCan you find where the PDFs added to Zotero live on your computer? Have they been renamed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCase B: Importing from PubMed (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re drafting a review and your PI has marked it up with many comments and track changes. In their comments they often mention papers your should reference, referred to only by their PubMed ID (PMID). Find a way to import them into Zotero (with their citation metadata) and organize them intelligently.\n\nThe compiled PMIDs:\n\n24934519,\n25159158,\n25682101,\n25702159,\n25865002,\n26025621,\n26212266,\n26246354\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGreen flag criteria:\n\n\n\nRaise the green flag when everyone at your table has:\n\nall 8 PDFs are in Zotero\nthey all have bibliographic data associated with them (a parent item)\nat least some are in a collection and/or have a tag\n\n\n\n\nTips for Case B:\nZotero is good at importing articles by identifiers like DOIs or, in this case, PMIDs. The Add Item(s) by Identifier icon  (magic wand at the top left of the center pane) is an easy way to add items by identifier. It can even handle multiple IDs at once.\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\nDoes Zotero import the PDF along with the metadata?\nAre there any peculiarities of the metadata imported from PubMed?\nIf you have the Zotero Connector installed, try importing the same article again from PubMed online or the journal website itself. How similar is the metadata?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCase C: Importing from web links (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re enjoying your Saturday when your PI sends you an email with no subject line or body text, just a bunch of URLs to some recently published journal articles. Find a way to import them into Zotero (with their citation metadata) and organize them intelligently.\n\nThe compiled links:\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.09.673536v1\nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-immunol-042718-041210\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1607804/full\nhttps://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/doi/10.1093/gigascience/giaf078/8232624\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGreen flag criteria:\n\n\n\nRaise the green flag when everyone at your table has:\n\nall 8 PDFs are in Zotero\nthey all have bibliographic data associated with them (a parent item)\nat least some are in a collection and/or have a tag\n\n\n\n\nTips for Case C:\nZotero imports from web links using a browser plugin called Zotero Connector, which you can install on the Zotero website along with the program itself. Connector uses scripts called translators to extract item metadata from a variety of websites. The translators generally work well on the sites where most biomedical research is published, including PubMed and those of Springer-Nature, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and many more.\nZotero Connector works best if you pin it to the toolbar of your browser. In its dormant state, the icon will look like this , but when you navigate to a website pertaining to a reference which can be translated into Zotero, the icon will change depending on the item type, e.g.,  for a journal article or  for a book chapter. Seeing this icon change is a reliable indicator that the item will be imported correctly, and clicking it will add the icon to your library.\nZotero will try to add the PDF as well. In my experience, ensuring that you already have access to the article—say, though OpenAthens—before you click the icon is the best way to guarantee the PDF comes along. If that fails, you can download the PDF separately and attach it to the item imported through Connector.\n\n\nDiscussion points:\n\nCan you think of any websites or otherwise unconventional reference items you may want to reference?\nWhat happens if you’re on a website with multiple reference items linked?\nCan you add items to your library from Zotero Connector if Zotero isn’t open?"

Each can show different types of information.\nZotero allows you to add Annotations and mark up PDFs a lot like other PDF viewers. When a PDF is open, the tools for different forms of annotations sit above the PDF in the center pane:\n\nClicking on the Toggle Sidebar icon  at the top left and selecting the Show Annotations  options will show you an overview of all annotations in the document.\nWhere Zotero can exceed the capabilities of other PDF viewers is in the synergy between annotations and Notes. Notes are a special type of item that can exist by themselves (“standalone notes”) or belong to a specific item (“item notes”). To create an item note, select the Notes icon  from the context menu on the right and click the + next to “Item Notes” &gt; Add Item Note:\n\nNotes can contain free-form text as well as content from PDFs such as annotations. With an item note open, any text in the PDF can be selected and added to it by selecting it, right-clicking, and clicking Add to Note. Annotations can be added to notes by selecting them in the PDF or sidebar and clicking Add to Note. Content added to notes in this way will also link back to the content in the PDF itself:\n\nAny content from any PDF in your library can be added to any note, so the range of information you can combine with notes is extremely flexible. An item note may contain a series of annotations just from that item along with your own comments, summarizing the main takeaways. In contrast, a standalone note may synthesize content from many sources in a way that makes it easy to reference back to each individual article."

    "section": "Activity #4: Custom RSS Feed",
    "text": "Activity #4: Custom RSS Feed\nImagine if you were, like me, really focused on one thing, like a species of bacteria called L. reuteri. You may decide that anytime a new paper mentions L. reuteri, you want to know about it. Or that every time your hopefully future-postdoc-lab publishes, you want to be the first to read it. Or that you want to at least read the title of each new review published in Nature Reviews So-and-So. Or any combination of the above. The “Create RSS” feature of PubMed gives you that power, and can integrate with Zotero itself.\nThis activity is more self-directed. The goal is to create a custom feed based on a PubMed search to help you stay up to date with newly published literature. There is no story problem for this part—it’s all up to you.\n\nUsing the “Create RSS” feature of PubMed search, experiment until you generate a search that feels useful to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGreen flag criteria:\n\n\n\nRaise the green flag when everyone at your table has:\n\nan RSS feed imported into Zotero\nthey have read an abstract, opened a link, or added an item to their library from their feed\nthey feel the feed may be useful to their work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTips for Activity #4\n\n\n\nPubMed has different ways to update you of new search hits. It can send you an email every week, or you can create a custom RSS feed which integrates with another program. RSS  is a standardized format for generating web feeds, kind of like a social media feed. You can add RSS feeds to Zotero similarly to adding an item. If the RSS feed is linked to a custom PubMed search you’ve created, Zotero will then contain a periodically updated feed of new PubMed entries which match that search, allowing you to browse the abstracts, access URLs, and even add them to your library without ever leaving Zotero. In my opinion, this close integration between where your literature lives and where it comes from makes browsing rather painless.\n\nSteps for making a custom RSS feed from PubMed\n\nGo to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nSearch something. Anything will do. The “Advanced” search option makes searching by a specific journal, author, or the like simpler; however, a generic keyword to start off is fine.\nClick “Create RSS” under the search bar:\n\nSome options will appear. I recommend changing “number of items displayed” to 100, and then hitting “Create RSS”.\nCopy the RSS feed link and return to Zotero.\nOn the menu bar, navigate to File &gt; New Library &gt; New Feed &gt; From URL…\nPaste the URL into the appropriate field. The title will automatically populate. I change the update frequency to “every 24 hours”, as the default “every 2 hours” feels excessive, but that’s just personal preference.\n\nVoila! There is now a new category in your Collections Pane, Feeds , which contains your custom feed . Unread feed items appear in bold, and since the feed is brand new, it now contains up to 100 bolded items. Items can be marked as read in a few different ways, and as new search hits arise they will appear at the top of the list in bold. When an item in the feed is selected, the Item Pane lists all the info needed to judge whether an article is worth taking a closer look at, like the abstract, as well as links to the PubMed entry and the DOI.\n\nThe URL generated for the RSS feed is permanently tied to that search. To edit the feed, run a new search in PubMed with your edited parameters and generate a new link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningA word of warning: too many hits (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are anything like me, your intellectual eyes are bigger than your stomach. Several feeds, each spawning dozens of new abstracts a day, is likely to result in fatigue; therefore, part of the art of generating an effective feed is appreciating the volume of hits you will be receiving. Thankfully, there is an easy way to check this in the redesigned PubMed interface.\nIn the current version of PubMed, the sidebar shows a histogram of search hits by year. Going back to my L. reuteri example, we can see there are 231 hits from the year 2024:\n\nThat means a bit less than 1 abstract a day—a manageable amount. In contrast, “lactobacillus” has 4,350 hits in 2024, while “limosilactobacillus reuteri” AND “bioengineering” has only 4. Experimenting till you hit a balance of topic specificity and hit volume will help make your feed more usable."
