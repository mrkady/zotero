	abstract = {Detecting viral RNA from wastewater has emerged as a cost-effective approach for community-level surveillance during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Although various concentrating methods have been developed, none are optimal for all key requirements for wastewater viral detection. Freeze-drying, a technique widely used for concentrating and preserving biological materials, remains underexplored for this purpose. This study compared the performance of freeze-drying and centrifugal ultrafiltration in terms of recovery efficiency, detection limit, and other key parameters. Early pandemic samples in this study, with extremely low viral concentrations, offered an ideal benchmark to assess their suitability for early-warning applications. Statistical analyses showed that freeze-drying achieved significantly higher recovery efficiency (20.2 +/- 3.8\% vs. 12.9 +/- 2.0\%), superior detection ratio (68.4\% vs. 31.6\%), and lower detection limit (0.06 vs. 0.35 copies/mL) compared to centrifugal ultrafiltration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply freeze-drying for wastewater-based viral detection. Despite its longer processing time, freeze-drying offers multiple advantages, including elimination of pretreatment steps, flexible storage, reduced RNA degradation under cryogenic conditions, minimal pathogen exposure, lower labor demands, and less human interference during processing. These features position freeze-drying as a novel alternative for wastewater-based viral surveillance, particularly for developing early-warning systems in resource-limited settings.},

	abstract = {BackgroundRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a complex and diverse etiology. The onset of RA is closely associated with intestinal flora, which is essential for immune regulation.MethodsFecal samples of 22 healthy controls and 38 patients with newly diagnosed RA were used for performing 16S rRNA sequencing, microbiota diversity assessment, and functional enrichment analysis. Through integrative analysis of random forest feature selection and bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR), Eubacterium rectale was prioritized as a key bacterial candidate associated with RA. Furthermore, E. rectale was used to treat the arthritis model mice by gavage treatment, and we evaluated joint inflammation and immune cell profile in mice. Finally, untargeted metabolomics was used to evaluate the changes in serum and fecal metabolites in the arthritis mouse model before and after E. rectale intervention.ResultsThe beta diversity of the intestinal flora exhibited significant differences between RA patients and healthy controls (HC). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that RA patients’ intestinal microbiota functions were enriched in pathways like genetic information processing and material metabolism. Further random forest model revealed E. rectale, Bacteroides, etc., and twelve genera with characteristic significance in RA patients. According to further MR analysis, Anaerostipes and E. rectale had a protective effect on RA, and reverse MR analysis showed no evidence of a causal relationship between these groups and RA. In vivo experiments showed that after the administration of E. rectale, the joint inflammation of the mice was relatively slight, the bone destruction and bone density of the joints improved, the proportion of Treg and follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) cells increased, and the proportion of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) cells decreased. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant changes in both serum and fecal metabolites in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) compared with healthy controls. The changes in metabolites such as butyric acid were reversed after treatment with E. rectal.ConclusionThe study demonstrates that E. rectale has a protective effect on RA. E. rectale significantly attenuates joint inflammation in mouse models by may regulating the expression level of butyrate, ameliorating the Treg and Tfr/Tfh immune imbalance status, and re-establishing the immune tolerance. These findings serve as valuable references for future studies on the pathogenesis of RA and the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {Neuropeptides represent the largest and most diverse class of cell-to-cell signaling molecules, holding important roles in animal physiology and behavior. They are evolutionarily ancient and widely distributed across the animal kingdom. Although over 200 neuropeptides have been identified, only a small fraction has been functionally characterized. A recognized bottleneck is the lack of effective tools to study their biological roles and therapeutic potential. Interestingly, neuropeptide-like peptides are also found in animal venoms, where they contribute to prey capture or defensive strategies. Mapping neuropeptide families across the animal kingdom is challenging due to their high sequence divergence and short mature peptide sequences. To address this, we developed PeptideMiner, a search tool that employs profile-hidden Markov models (profile-HMMs) for family-specific peptide discovery. PeptideMiner was systematically validated and benchmarked against existing methods, demonstrating its superior performance. By applying PeptideMiner to several venom transcriptomes—including 24 previously unpublished datasets—we identified 10 novel natriuretic peptides from distantly related species and 57 novel insulin-like sequences from marine predatory cone snails. Chemical synthesis and structure–activity relationship studies of newly identified conoinsulins at human insulin receptors emphasized the value of our approach in elucidating ligand–receptor interactions and discovering new pharmacological probes and therapeutic leads. PeptideMiner offers a powerful platform for discovering new bioactive peptides and family-specific analogues, accelerating both natural product discovery and evolutionary research.},

	abstract = {Many prokaryotic cells are encased in a para-crystalline sheath composed of lattice-forming proteins, collectively known as the surface layer (S-layer). S-layer proteins are among the most abundant proteins in archaea and bacteria. They exhibit remarkable sequence and structural diversity, while performing essential structural, protective and physiological functions. Recent advances in structural biology, cell biology and bioinformatics have reshaped our understanding of S-layer biogenesis and organization, while also revealing that S-layers are far more widespread among prokaryotes than previously envisaged. In addition, it has become increasingly clear that S-layers have crucial roles in microbial interactions and community dynamics. In this Review, we explore the architectural principles and self-assembly mechanisms that govern S-layers and examine their diverse functional roles in mediating interactions with the external environment of prokaryotes. We argue that deeper insights into these abundant surface structures are critical for understanding how they mediate multicellular interactions; a key step towards deciphering the organization of biofilms and microbiomes, which are fundamental modes of microbial life on Earth.},
