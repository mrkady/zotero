IF allows for excellent sensitivity and amplification of signal in comparison to immunohistochemistry, employing various microscopy techniques. There are two methods available, depending on the scope of the experiment or the specific antibodies in use: direct (primary) or indirect (secondary). Here, we describe preparation of specimens preserved in different types of media and step-by-step methods for both direct and indirect immunofluorescence staining.},

	abstract = {Wnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland.},

	abstract = {The genus Lactobacillus comprises 261 species (at March 2020) that are extremely diverse at phenotypic, ecological and genotypic levels. This study evaluated the taxonomy of Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae on the basis of whole genome sequences. Parameters that were evaluated included core genome phylogeny, (conserved) pairwise average amino acid identity, clade-specific signature genes, physiological criteria and the ecology of the organisms. Based on this polyphasic approach, we propose reclassification of the genus Lactobacillus into 25 genera including the emended genus Lactobacillus, which includes host-adapted organisms that have been referred to as the Lactobacillus delbrueckii group, Paralactobacillus and 23 novel genera for which the names Holzapfelia, Amylolactobacillus, Bombilactobacillus, Companilactobacillus, Lapidilactobacillus, Agrilactobacillus, Schleiferilactobacillus, Loigolactobacilus, Lacticaseibacillus, Latilactobacillus, Dellaglioa, Liquorilactobacillus, Ligilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, Furfurilactobacillus, Paucilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Fructilactobacillus, Acetilactobacillus, Apilactobacillus, Levilactobacillus, Secundilactobacillus and Lentilactobacillus are proposed. We also propose to emend the description of the family Lactobacillaceae to include all genera that were previously included in families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. The generic term 'lactobacilli' will remain useful to designate all organisms that were classified as Lactobacillaceae until 2020. This reclassification reflects the phylogenetic position of the micro-organisms, and groups lactobacilli into robust clades with shared ecological and metabolic properties, as exemplified for the emended genus Lactobacillus encompassing species adapted to vertebrates (such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensensii, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus acidophilus) or invertebrates (such as Lactobacillus apis and Lactobacillus bombicola).},

	abstract = {Antibiotics are essential for modern medicine, but their use drives the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that limits the long-term efficacy of any one drug. To keep pace with AMR and preserve our ability to treat bacterial infections, it is essential that we identify antibiotics with new structures and targets that are not affected by clinical resistance. Historically, most developmental candidates for antibiotics have come from microbial natural products, as they feature chemical structures and biological activities that have been honed over millions of years of evolution. Unfortunately, as classical bioactivity screens for natural product discovery are blind to the pharmacological properties of their hits, they often identify molecules with functional groups that limit their utility as drugs. One prominent example is actinonin, an inhibitor of bacterial peptide deformylase (PDF) whose activity is dependent on a hydroxamate moiety associated with toxicity in vivo. The abundance of bacterial genomes now presents an opportunity for target-based natural product discovery, where biosynthetic pathways can be mined for molecules that possess desired activities but lack known pharmacophores. Here, we use bioinformatics to lead a chemotype-sensitive, target-based search for natural product inhibitors of bacterial PDF that lack the conserved metal chelating group. We describe the discovery, heterologous expression, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and activity of the gammanonins: actinonin homologues from Gammaproteobacteria. Moving forward, we hope this chemotype- and target-driven approach will help to expedite the discovery of new leads for antibiotic development.},

	doi = {10.1101/2025.09.24.678173},
	abstract = {Human disruption of ecosystems poses a significant threat to global health, driving the need for low-cost, low-power, and easily deployable sensors for environmental and health monitoring. Microbial bioelectronic sensors are particularly well-suited as they generate electrical signals and can be integrated into compact electronic devices for field deployment over extended periods. However, current engineering strategies for bioelectronic sensors lack modularity, are limited to a few microbial chassis, and depend on specialized instruments for signal detection. Here, we present the electroactive co-culture sensing system (e-COSENS), a plug-and-play platform for bioelectronic sensor development. This system comprises a 'sender' bacterium that produces electron mediators in response to analytes and a 'receiver' bacterium that utilizes the electron mediators to generate electrical signals via extracellular electron transfer (EET). By modularly swapping the sender bacterium and its associated genetic sensing elements, we achieved bioelectronic sensing of metals, small molecules, and peptides in distinct environmental, food, and human-relevant settings. Moreover, we designed a centimeter-sized bioelectronic device that enables low-cost, portable signal readout from e-COSENS using a household digital multimeter. The e-COSENS platform greatly simplifies the bioelectronic sensor design and opens unprecedented potential for bioelectronic sensor applications.},

	abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},
