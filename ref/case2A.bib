	abstract = {Maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deﬁcits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identiﬁed a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deﬁcits in MHFD offspring. Our ﬁndings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve speciﬁc behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.},

              One of the enduring mysteries of autoimmunity is the identity of the specific proteins targeted by autoimmune T cells. Delong
              et al.
              used mass spectrometry to elucidate the peptide targets of autoimmune T cells isolated from a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. T cells targeted hybrid peptides formed by the covalent linking of a peptide derived from pro-insulin to other peptides derived from proteins found in pancreatic beta cells. T cells isolated from the pancreatic islets of two individuals with type 1 diabetes also recognized such hybrid peptides, suggesting that they may play an important role in driving disease.

            Autoimmune T cells recognize covalently linked peptides derived from two distinct proteins.
          , 
            T cell–mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas causes type 1 diabetes (T1D). CD4 T cell responses play a central role in β cell destruction, but the identity of the epitopes recognized by pathogenic CD4 T cells remains unknown. We found that diabetes-inducing CD4 T cell clones isolated from nonobese diabetic mice recognize epitopes formed by covalent cross-linking of proinsulin peptides to other peptides present in β cell secretory granules. These hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) are antigenic for CD4 T cells and can be detected by mass spectrometry in β cells. CD4 T cells from the residual pancreatic islets of two organ donors who had T1D also recognize HIPs. Autoreactive T cells targeting hybrid peptides may explain how immune tolerance is broken in T1D.},

            Our understanding of region-specific microbial function within the gut is limited due to reliance on stool. Using a recently developed capsule device, we exploit regional sampling from the human intestines to develop models for interrogating small intestine (SI) microbiota composition and function.
            In vitro
            culturing of human intestinal contents produced stable, representative communities that robustly colonize the SI of germ-free mice. During mouse colonization, the combination of SI and stool microbes altered gut microbiota composition, functional capacity, and response to diet, resulting in increased diversity and reproducibility of SI colonization relative to stool microbes alone. Using a diverse strain library representative of the human SI microbiota, we constructed defined communities with taxa that largely exhibited the expected regional preferences. Response to a fiber-deficient diet was region-specific and reflected strain-specific fiber-processing and host mucus-degrading capabilities, suggesting that dietary fiber is critical for maintaining SI microbiota homeostasis. These tools should advance mechanistic modeling of the human SI microbiota and its role in disease and dietary responses.},
